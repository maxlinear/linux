Maxlinear VPN driver

Maxlinear VPN driver is a driver that serves as interface between linux and VPN
ARC-EM6 firmware, used in Maxlinear LGM SoC.
Its job includes loading the firmware, provide necessary information to it,
and also miscellanous functionalities e.g. debugging features. It also need
to interracts with other modules i.e. datapath and PPA.

Required properties:
- compatible	: should be "mxl,lgm-vpn" (A-Step) or "mxl,lgm-vpn-b" (B-Step)
- resets	: list of phandle and reset specifier pairs for ARC-EM6 firmware
- reset-names	: list of reset signal names. Should be "arcem".
		  See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt
- mxl,sram	: list of phandle to VPN sram area
		  See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sram/sram.txt
- mxl,syscon	: phandle to sysconf chiptop

Required properties for B-Step:
- interrupt-parent	: phandle to ioapic
- interrupts		: atom-to-arc interrupt specifier

Optional properties:
- umt-period-us	: UMT period (in us). Default to 10us if not defined.

Example:

sram@e7b00000 {
	compatible = "mmio-sram";
	reg = <0xe7b00000 0x4000>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges = <0 0xe7b00000 0x4000>;
	vpn_sram: vpn_sram@0 {
		reg = <0x0 0x4000>;
		pool;
	};
};

vpn: vpn {
	compatible = "mxl,lgm-vpn";
	resets = <&rcu0 0x70 12>;
	reset-names = "arcem";
	mxl,sram = <&vpn_sram>;
	mxl,syscon = <&sysconf>; /* chiptop */
};
